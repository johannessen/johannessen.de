		<P>&#8220;I&#8217;m fine. It was only rain.&#8221;</P>
		<P>Aitrus stood there a moment, hesistant, not sure just what to say, then: &#8220;Would you like a game of <EM>Gemedet?</EM>&#8221;</P>
		<P>&#8220;All right.&#8221;</P>
		<P>He grinned, then nodded and turned away, returning to the tent to bring the grid. Smiling, Anna stood, then went across to clear a space on the table.</P>
		<P><EM>Gemedet,</EM> or six-in-a-line, was the most popular of D&#8217;ni games. She had seen a close variant of the game in Tadjinar, played by the Chinese merchants, but the D&#8217;ni version was played not on a two-dimensional board but on a complex three-dimensional grid, nine squares to a side.</P>
		<P>It was, she thought, the perfect game for a race embedded in the rock, whose thinking was not lateral but spatial.</P>
		<P>Aitrus returned a moment later, setting the grid down on the table. It was a beautiful thing, of hand-carved lilac jade, as delicate-looking as a honeycomb yet strong. Strong enough to have survived a thousand games without a single chip or blemish.</P>
		<P>The base of the grid was a polished hemisphere of topaz on which the grid revolved smoothly. Long, silver tweezers, called <EM LANG="x-dni-en">re&#8217;dantee,</EM> were used to slip the playing pieces into place, while the pieces themselves were simple polished ovoids of green tourmaline and dark red almandine.</P>
		<P>Both the <SPAN LANG="x-dni-en">re&#8217;dantee</SPAN> and the &#8220;stones&#8221; were kept in a velvet-lined box, which Aitrus now opened, placing it on the table beside the grid, so that both of them could easily reach it.</P>
		<P>Anna smiled. She had fallen in love with the set at first sight.</P>
