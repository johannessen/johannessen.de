Title: FPinfo 1.1 with Flyscripts
Author: Arne Johannessen
Simulator: Fly!
Freeware

Description:
This little script displays your flight plan while flying. Now the lazy people (like myself ;-) ) don't need to write it down or even interrupt the flight anymore -- just press a key to get the heading you have to fly after reaching the next waypoint. The displayed information will be like "Leg 5: WARBURG (6000ft) to MOHNE: 261° 40.7nm".
Now with correct speed information and (hopefully) corrected display of the degree symbol on PCs.
